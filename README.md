## About The Project
This is a simplified version of [BO19E-15_SensorVehicle](https://github.com/BjAlvestad/BO19E-15_SensorVehicle)

## Getting Started
* Clone this repository:</u>**
```sh
git clone https://github.com/BjAlvestad/BO19E-15_SensorVehicle-Simplified.git
```

* Install HVL SensorVehicle Simulator from [Microsoft Store](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/hvl-sensorvehicle-simulator/9nbs6gn8sqlg?activetab=pivot:overviewtab)
* Open SensorVehicle-main.sln and navigate to one of the StudentXX.cs-files

## Usage
![Control logic example](%5BDrawings%20and%20Documents%5D/Pictures/DriveToLargestDistance.png) <br>
The above example shows how one can make the car drive towards the largest distance reported by the LiDAR.

To write your own control logic, navigate to the files in the picture below.
The different StudentXX.cs-files contains instruction where to write the control logic. <br>
